# Designing an HPLC Method

## Column Selection
The column is the heart of HPLC. Choose based on your sample’s chemistry:  
- **Reversed-Phase (C18)**: Default for most organic compounds (e.g., drugs, pesticides).  
- **HILIC (Hydrophilic Interaction)**: For very polar compounds (e.g., sugars, amino acids).  
- **Ion-Exchange**: Charged molecules like proteins or nucleotides.  
- **Particle Size**:  
  - **5 µm**: Standard for most applications.  
  - **3 µm or smaller**: Faster runs but higher pressure.  

**Example**:  
- Analyzing **ibuprofen** (non-polar) in a tablet: Use a C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 µm).

## Mobile Phase Optimization
The mobile phase’s composition controls separation. Key factors:  
- **Organic Modifier**: Methanol (cheap) or acetonitrile (sharper peaks).  
- **pH**: Adjust with buffers (e.g., phosphate, acetate) for ionizable compounds.  
- **Gradient vs. Isocratic**: Start with isocratic for simple mixtures; use gradient for complex samples.  

**Example**:  
- Separating **caffeine** and **aspirin**:  
  - **Isocratic**: 40% methanol, 60% water (pH 2.5 with phosphoric acid).  
  - **Gradient**: Ramp from 20% to 60% methanol for better resolution.

## pH Adjustments
- **Acidic Compounds** (e.g., aspirin): Lower pH (2–3) keeps them neutral, improving retention on C18.  
- **Basic Compounds** (e.g., nicotine): Higher pH (7–8) prevents ionization, enhancing interaction with the column.  

**Example**:  
- Analyzing **vitamin C** (acidic): Use pH 2.5 to keep it non-ionized for better retention.

## Balancing Speed, Resolution, and Sensitivity
- **Speed**: Increase flow rate or use shorter columns (but risk lower resolution).  
- **Resolution**: Use smaller particles or gradient elution (but takes longer).  
- **Sensitivity**: Optimize detector settings (e.g., UV wavelength) or concentrate the sample.  

**Trade-Off Table**:  
| Goal               | Action                          | Compromise                        |  
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| **Faster Run**      | Use 3 µm particles             | Higher pressure, shorter column life |  
| **Better Resolution** | Reduce flow rate              | Longer run time                   |  
| **Higher Sensitivity** | Inject more sample          | Risk of column overload           |
