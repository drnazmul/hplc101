This was me two decades ago—a novice chemist overwhelmed by HPLC’s complexity. Today, after training hundreds of students and professionals, I’ve learned one truth: **HPLC mastery begins with simplicity**.  \n\nThis book was born from countless lab sessions where I witnessed talented individuals struggle not with science, but with *how we teach it*. Traditional resources drown readers in equations and engineering details, leaving practical skills as an afterthought. *HPLC for All* flips this model.  \n\nHere, we focus on **what truly matters in daily lab work**:  \n- How to recognize a failing pump (listen for the “hiccups”)  \n- Why adjusting the mobile phase is like tuning a radio for clearer signals  \n- When to suspect a contaminated column (spoiler: ghost peaks tell stories)  \n\nYou’ll find no differential equations here—just actionable insights drawn from real chromatography challenges. The coffee stain on Chapter 3? That’s from testing caffeine analysis methods at midnight. The hand-drawn sketches? Born from explaining HPLC to my daughter using toy cars and sand filters.  \n\nThis book is for those who learn by *doing*, not deriving. Whether you’re analyzing herbal medicines in Nairobi or wastewater in New Delhi, the core principles remain universal.  \n\nA heartfelt thank you to the technicians, students, and fellow scientists who shaped these lessons. Your questions—especially the “silly” ones—taught me how to teach.  \n\nNow, let’s turn confusion into confidence. Your HPLC journey starts here.
