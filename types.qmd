# Separation Modes & Elution Techniques {#sec-types .unnumbered}

 HPLC separates mixtures by exploiting differences in interactions between sample components, the stationary phase (column), and the mobile phase (eluent). 
 This chapter explores the major separation modes and elution techniques used in HPLC, with practical examples to illustrate their applications.
