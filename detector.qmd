# Detectors

 
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) detectors act as the "eyes" of the system, converting separated compounds into measurable signals. This chapter explores 8 essential detector types, their strengths, weaknesses, and real-world applications - critical knowledge for selecting the right tool in analytical workflows.

## UV-Vis Detectors  
**How they work**: Measure light absorption between 190-900 nm using chromophores (light-absorbing molecular structures).  

**Types**:  
- **Fixed wavelength**: Simple design (254 nm mercury lamps) for routine drug analysis
- **Variable wavelength**: Adjustable λ (190-900 nm) for method development labs
- **Diode Array (DAD)**: Simultaneously captures full UV spectrum, ideal for peak purity checks

*Advantages*:  
- Cost-effective for 90% of small molecules with chromophores
- Compatible with gradient elution  

*Limitations*:  
- Useless for compounds without UV activity (e.g., sugars)  
- Mobile phase must be UV-transparent  

*Applications*:  
- Pharmaceutical QC (paracetamol quantification)  
- Caffeine analysis in beverages

## Fluorescence Detectors (FLD)  
**Mechanism**: Excites compounds at specific λ, measures emitted light.  

*Advantages*:  
- 1000x more sensitive than UV for fluorescing agents  
- Selective - reduces matrix interference  

*Limitations*:  
- Requires native fluorescence or derivatization (e.g., dansyl chloride for amines)
- Limited to ~15% of analytes  

*Applications*:  
- Aflatoxin detection in foods  
- Environmental PAH monitoring

## Refractive Index (RI) Detectors  
**Principle**: Measures mobile phase refractive index changes.  

*Advantages*:  
- "Universal" - detects any compound  
- No analyte property needed  

*Limitations*:  
- Poor sensitivity (μg range)  
- Can't use with gradient elution  
- Temperature-sensitive  

*Applications*:  
- Sugar profiling in juices  
- Polymer molecular weight analysis

## Evaporative Light Scattering (ELSD)  
**Operation**: Nebulizes eluent, detects scattered light from non-volatile particles.  

*Advantages*:  
- Works with gradients  
- Detects non-UV actives (lipids, carbs)  

*Limitations*:  
- Requires volatile buffers  
- Moderate sensitivity  

*Applications*:  
- Triglyceride analysis in oils  
- Natural product characterization

## Conductivity Detectors  
**Function**: Measures ionic conductivity changes.  

*Advantages*:  
- Ideal for ions (Na⁺, NO₃⁻)  
- Low maintenance  

*Limitations*:  
- Needs ionizable analytes  
- Interference from buffer ions  

*Applications*:  
- Drinking water anion analysis  
- QC of saline formulations

## Mass Spectrometers (LC-MS)  
**Technology**: Ionizes molecules, separates by mass/charge ratio.  

*Advantages*:  
- Provides structural ID  
- Ultra-sensitive (pg levels)  

*Limitations*:  
- High cost (~$300k)  
- Complex operation  

*Applications*:  
- Metabolite identification  
- Proteomics research

## Light Scattering Detectors  
**Variants**:  
- **Multi-angle (MALS)**: Determines absolute molecular weight  
- **Right-angle**: Simpler design for proteins  

*Applications*:  
- Biopharmaceutical aggregation studies  
- Polymer branching analysis

## Niche Detectors  
**Electrochemical**: For redox-active compounds (catecholamines)  
**Radioactivity**: Track radiolabeled drugs in metabolism studies

## Selection Guide  
| Factor               | Detector Choices          |  
|-----------------------|---------------------------|  
| Universal detection   | RI, ELSD                  |  
| Sensitivity           | FLD, MS                   |  
| Structural ID         | MS                        |  
| Ion analysis          | Conductivity              |  
| Budget constraints    | UV-Vis, RI               |  

**Pro Tip**: 72% of labs use UV + secondary detector (2024 Lab Manager Survey). Pair DAD with ELSD for broad coverage.

This detector "toolbox" approach empowers analysts to match detection strategy with analyte properties and study goals. Subsequent chapters will explore hyphenated techniques like LC-MS/MS in depth.
